## Project Overview

This project was conducted as part of a school assignment and focuses on addressing the question: "How can we store and access information rapidly in an era of exponential data growth?" The project delves into the functioning of HDDs and SSDs, comparing their technologies, and analyzing their strengths and weaknesses.

The main objectives of the project are as follows:
- Study the components and operation of Hard Disk Drives and Solid State Drives.
- Explore the functioning of a Robot-Disque-Dur, simulating a Hard Disk Drive.
- Investigate the properties of transistors and their role in Solid State Drives.
- Conduct a simulation of a Transistor at the electronic scale.
- Compare the advantages and disadvantages of HDDs and SSDs.
- Discuss recent technologies that may impact future data storage.
- Present a conclusion and possible directions for future data storage technologies.
